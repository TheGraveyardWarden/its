When to Use __syncwarp

You use __syncwarp() in the following scenarios:

    Ensure Memory Consistency Within a Warp: If threads within a warp write to shared memory and then read from it, __syncwarp() ensures that all threads have finished writing before any start reading. This is a finer-grained synchronization compared to __syncthreads(), which applies to the entire thread block.

    Resolve Divergence: If warp threads diverge (e.g., due to conditional branches), __syncwarp() can be used to synchronize them after they converge.

    Explicit Synchronization: In modern CUDA versions (starting with Volta), implicit synchronization within a warp is not guaranteed in all cases. For example, if you use shared memory or perform reductions, explicit synchronization with __syncwarp() might be necessary.

Sample Use Cases for __syncwarp()
1. Shared Memory Read/Write Synchronization

__global__ void warpSharedMemoryExample(int *data) {
    __shared__ int shared[32];

    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int lane = tid % 32; // Lane index within the warp

    // Each thread writes to shared memory
    shared[lane] = tid;
    
    // Synchronize within the warp to ensure writes are complete
    __syncwarp();

    // Each thread reads from shared memory
    data[tid] = shared[(lane + 1) % 32];
}

2. Warp-Level Reduction

__global__ void warpReductionExample(int *input, int *output) {
    int tid = threadIdx.x;
    int lane = tid % 32; // Lane index within the warp

    int value = input[tid];

    // Perform warp reduction
    for (int offset = 16; offset > 0; offset /= 2) {
        value += __shfl_down_sync(0xFFFFFFFF, value, offset);
    }

    // Synchronize to ensure reduction is complete
    __syncwarp();

    // Write the result for the first lane
    if (lane == 0) {
        output[tid / 32] = value;
    }
}

Key Points:

    __syncwarp() is lightweight compared to __syncthreads() because it only applies to threads in the same warp.
    Explicit use of __syncwarp() becomes crucial when:
        You're operating in shared memory within a warp.
        Threads within a warp diverge.
        You're dealing with warp-level primitives (__shfl_*, etc.) and need explicit synchronization.
